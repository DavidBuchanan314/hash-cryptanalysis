# Hash Cryptanalysis

These are basically my study notes, I might try to turn this into a tutorial of sorts at some point, but for now I'm just making it up as I go along.

If you want to follow along, start with [md4](./md4/)

## List of papers I think might be relevant:

- ["How to Break MD5 and Other Hash Functions"](https://iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2005/34940019/34940019.pdf), Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu, Eurocrypt 2005

- [A Study of the MD5 Attacks: Insights and Improvements](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/papers/md5e-full.pdf) - Black, Cochran, Highland, 2006

- [Collisions for the compression function of MD5](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/333359) - Boer, Bosselaers, 1993
